Take the junk out of the river with your line.

Bumping junk that you have caught will dislodge it from your line.

Don't catch the fish with your line.

If you catch a fish, you'll have to dislodge it from your line and the fish
will swim away.

When all the fish have swum away, the game is over. 

One-finger Controls:
